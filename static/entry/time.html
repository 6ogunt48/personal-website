            <h3 class="heading-primary">TIME</h3>
            <br> <br>
            <p>I started reading the book of genesis to deepen my understanding of the concept of life as a whole.
                However, as
                you all know, I always reflect on my learning and experiences, so I can test my understanding, and
                that's
                how I figured out the concept of time. Although it needs more proof to back it up while I read other
                parts of the bible to figure out the hidden parts, but here is the little gathered so far:<br>


                Time has been in existence even before it was measured .In fact, God had used time to create the earth
                by
                segregating his actions into days, and executing them day by day. Time was part of his initial design
                for man, and it was also part of the gifts he never declared but to leave man to figure out on its own.

                Genesis 1 outlines the creation of the world in a sequence of days, each marked by <span
                        class="highlights"> "there was evening,
                and there was morning."</span> This structure implies an awareness of time even before human beings
                began to
                measure it. It's a poetic way of describing God's creative process unfolding over a period, whether
                these "days" are understood as literal 24-hour periods or as symbolic phases. The creation of celestial
                bodies on the fourth day (Genesis 1:14–19) is specifically linked to the marking of time. <span
                        class="highlights"> These verses
                    state that the sun, moon, and stars are to serve as signs to mark sacred times, days, and years </span>.
                This
                suggests that time, and its measurement, is not just a human invention but a part of the divine order
                established by God.</p> <br>

            <h4 class="heading-tertiary">How has this increased my fate?</h4>
            <p> After understanding this , my faith and patience grew more in God because I seek answers a lot and now I
                understand that not all questions have immediate answers until the time is near when he is ready to
                reveal it to you.infact , we may think that we need something to happen In our life now but God has seen
                before us and he knows the right time to execute his actions .for instance, Jesus coming was something
                that was specifically timed by God.

                <span class="highlights"> In Galatians 4:4, it says,  "But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son..."</span>

                Time, Gods plan, the fulfilment of prophecies intertwines, and they work together. If God reveals a
                prophecy, he wants you to be prepared that a time would come when he would fulfil that prophecy</p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="heading-tertiary"> Why is time a precious gift?</h4>
            <p> In fact, our first gift of time is the lifetime God specifically gave us, which is also highlighted in
                the Psalms of David. <span class="highlights"> Psalm 90:10 says, 'Our days may come to seventy years, or eighty, if our strength
                    endures.'</span> Whether you are starting a business, learning a new language, or building a family,
                God has
                given you enough time to make it happen. You need to be judicious with your time and focus on what truly
                matters.

                Whether you receive a pay raise or learn a new skill, your compensation is often based on the hours you
                put in. In fact, the wealthy accumulate wealth not just for their own sake but to buy freedom, allowing
                them the time to do anything they want.</p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="heading-tertiary"> Humans envy your time and not your wealth</h4>
            <p>Human envy often targets not one's wealth, but rather the time one has to enjoy it. Whether it's
                achieving academic accolades at an unusually young age, becoming the youngest professor at 19, or
                reaching the pinnacle of wealth as a CEO at 65, these milestones are ordained by God to occur at
                specific times. Yet, society frequently associates success with certain ages, leading many to
                prematurely force their blessings, under the misconception that success must align with societal age
                norms. In truth, God does not confine our successes to age limits.

                For instance, a 65-year-old wealthy individual might attract less envy because society rationalizes
                their success as a result of age and long-term effort. In contrast, a 25-year-old in a similar position
                might face more envy and hostility. This isn't necessarily due to their wealth, but because of their
                youth, which signifies a potentially longer duration of enjoying God's blessings. This young age,
                juxtaposed with significant success, can ignite feelings of jealousy in others, as they perceive a long
                road of prosperity ahead for the individual.

                Similarly, being a trailblazer in your family, like the first to become a CEO, might not always be met
                with support from relatives. This lack of support often stems from comparisons with their own
                achievements or timelines, rather than a genuine lack of merit in your accomplishments.

                <span class="highlights"> In essence, it is crucial to recognize that God’s plans for each individual are unique and not bound by
                    societal expectations of age or timing </span>. Our journey and the timing of our successes are divinely
                orchestrated, and understanding this can help us appreciate our own path and that of others without
                succumbing to societal pressures or envy.


                Now lets go back to Genesis 37 - 50
                Infact God told Joseph in is dream he would rule over his brothers all, which are way older than him,
                and
                they would bow down before him. This envy led to him being sold into slavery, a turn of events that,
                while devastating, was part of God's greater plan, and he eventually becomes a ruler of a country at 30
                years old (prime minister).</p> <br>

            <h4 class="heading-tertiary"> God wants your time</h4>
            <p>Now that you understand the concept of time and know that God has created and allocated time for you on
                Earth to flourish and have dominion, it's your turn to give a portion of your time back to Him. I can't
                decide how much of your time you need to dedicate, but it's only fair to do so. Whether it's through
                praise, worship, or other forms of devotion, I can't determine that for you. However, allocating a
                portion of your time to God might be the answer to your worries.<br> <br>


                Overall , this is where my curiosity has lead me to, while I seek answers from leaders , I also do not
                agree about everything I listen to or read from people as I have that natural inquisitive nature of
                finding out answers on my own .but nevertheless, Please let me know if this read has been worth your
                time.</p>
